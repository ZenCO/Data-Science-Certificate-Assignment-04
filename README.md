Utilizing dplyr

#### Homework  

Complete all exercises within `transform.Rmd`. Make sure that you run `install.packages(c('nycflights13', 'Lahman'))` because these are required (along with the tidyverse, which you already have installed.)

Remember, you can hit `ctrl + alt + i` in order to add a code block (wherever your cursor is).

The `transform.Rmd` file is take DIRECTLY out of the R4DS textbook (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - full credit to them for providing this.
